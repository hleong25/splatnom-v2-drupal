# This is splatnom v2

Splatnom is a personal project. It is a restaurant menu based project.

The goal was to have a site that is menu based and each menu item is in a database. Users would upload images of food and tag the image with the menu items. For voting, users would "fork it" if they enjoy the food.

When searching, the user would search for "fish tacos", and going through the menu items in the database, it would return a list of fish taco pictures, sorted by "fork it".

This version 2 is based off drupal.
